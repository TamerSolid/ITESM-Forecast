# **Time Series Analysis with Power BI**
Classroom Case for students

## Introduction
Welcome to the Time Series Analysis project repository! This project is designed for students who are interested in exploring time series data and forecasting techniques using Power BI. In this README, you will find essential information to get started with the project.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze time series data and apply forecasting methods using Power BI. Time series analysis is a critical skill in various fields, including finance, marketing, and operations, as it enables us to make data-driven predictions based on historical data patterns.

## Getting Started
To begin your time series analysis with Power BI, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation:** Prepare your time series data. Ensure that it's in a suitable format for analysis, preferably in a CSV or Excel file.

2. **Install Power BI:** If you haven't already, download and install Power BI Desktop, which is available for free from the [Power BI website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/).

3. **Open the Power BI Project:** Open the Power BI project file provided in the repository using Power BI Desktop.

4. **Import Data:** Import your time series data into Power BI, and start exploring your dataset.

## Forecasting Methods
Here are some suggested forecasting methods you can explore in this project:

1. **Moving Averages:** Calculate simple or weighted moving averages to smooth out noise in your time series data.

2. **Exponential Smoothing:** Apply exponential smoothing techniques such as Single Exponential Smoothing (SES), Double Exponential Smoothing (DES), or Triple Exponential Smoothing (TES).

3. **ARIMA Modeling:** Experiment with AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models to capture trends and seasonality in your data.

4. **Prophet:** Explore Facebook Prophet, an open-source forecasting tool, which is particularly useful for time series data with strong seasonal patterns.

5. **Machine Learning Models/LSTM:** If you have a largerdataset, consider machine learning-based approaches like decision trees, random forests, or neural networks for forecasting.
6. 
7. **Long Short-Term Memory / LSTM:** 

## Validation Tool
For validating your forecasting method, consider using the following techniques:

1. **Train-Test Split:** Split your time series data into a training set and a test set to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

2. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Calculate the MAE to measure the accuracy of your forecasts. Lower MAE values indicate better performance.

3. **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):** RMSE provides a measure of the model's prediction error, with lower values indicating better accuracy.

4. **Visual Inspection:** Plot your forecasts alongside the actual time series data to visually assess how well your model captures the patterns and trends.

5. **Residual Analysis:** Analyze the residuals (differences between actual and predicted values) to check for any remaining patterns or biases.

## Conclusion
This repository is a starting point for your time series analysis journey using Power BI. Feel free to customize your analysis, explore different corecasting methods, and enhance your understanding of time series data. Happy Analyzing!
